1 Overview
**********

Octopress.el is a (more) humane interface for using the Octopress
blogging system within Emacs.

   Octopress.el provides interactive commands for creating and
publishing drafts, posts, and pages; can start and stop the local server
for previewing your site; and can even deploy your site right from
within Emacs.

   Because the entire command line interface was overhauled in 3.0,
Octopress.el will only work with Octopress 3.0 or higher.  There are no
plans to support prior versions of Octopress.

   For more information on using Octopress.el, *note Using Octopress::.

2 Installing
************

The recommended way to install Octopress.el is from the MELPA package
repository.  If you are reading this, the chances are good that you've
already installed it, but if you haven't, the normal guidelines apply:

   To install Octopress.el from its Github repository, clone it into a
location of your choice (usually within your '~/.emacs.d') and add that
location to your 'load-path'.

2.1 Installing from MELPA
=========================

Follow these steps to install Octopress.el from the MELPA repository.

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
     	     '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

Then refresh your packages list:

     M-x package-refresh-contents RET

And finally, install Octopress.el:

     M-x package-install RET octopress RET

3 Using Octopress
*****************

Octopress.el provides a central "dashboard", called the status buffer,
from which you can manage your posts and drafts, start and stop the
server, and so on.

3.1 Displaying the status buffer
================================

To open the status buffer, simply run 'octopress-status'.  If you are
currently editing a buffer within your Octopress blog site, Octopress.el
will assume you wish to manage that site and open immediately.  If you
are not editing such a buffer (or your 'cwd' is not within an Octopress
site), you will be prompted to locate the root of your Octopress site.

   You may wish to map a key to Octopress.el.  If that is the case, it
is recommended that such a mapping call 'octopress-status'.

   The status screen consists of several headings:

   * Blog root

   * Server

   * Drafts

   * Posts

   You can move the "focus" between the items on this screen by pressing
'n' or 'p' ("next" and "previous", respectively).

   The "Drafts" and "Posts" sections will list the draft and post files
present within your site.  By default, the "Drafts" section is expanded
and the "Posts" section is collapsed.  You can toggle the expansion of a
section by pressing 'TAB' while focused on it.

   You can also move quickly to the next or previous section heading
(which you might do to jump from a line containing a draft or post to
its section heading) by pressing 'C-n' or 'C-p' ("next section" and
"previous section", respectively).

3.2 Running commands
====================

Of course, Octopress.el would be pretty useless if all it did was show
you lists of files!

   To see all of the commands available, press '?' within the status
buffer.  A split window will open displaying the various keys and what
they do (a la Magit).  Some keys must be pressed while the focus is on a
certain type of item, such as "publish" and "unpublish," while others
can be invoked from anywhere, such as "server" and "deploy."

   There are three commands that require a little more explanation:
"create," "build," and "server" are interactive commands, which will
allow you to configure exactly what they do.

   When you invoke one of those three commands, the minibuffer will
display a "toggles" line, allowing you to select the options for the
command.  For example, pressing 's' to invoke the "server" command
displays the following toggles line:

     ([d]rafts [f]uture [u]npublished) [s] Server, [k] Kill, [q] Abort

   Pressing the 'd', 'f', or 'u' keys will toggle the state of those
flags, each of which represents a class of post that should be served by
the server when it starts.  Toggles that appear in red are disabled, and
the others are enabled.

   To maintain compatibility with other themes, the default toggle
colors use the 'font-lock-warning-face' for disabled toggles and the
'font-lock-string-face' for enabled toggles.  The actual faces used are
customizable through 'M-x customize-group RET octopress RET'.

   Finally, pressing one of 's', 'k', or 'q' will dismiss the
minibuffer, performing the operation described.

   The same toggles are available for the "build" command, and the
"create" command will ask you what you want to create, but has no
toggles.

3.3 Working with drafts and posts
=================================

Quite often, you will start a draft or two and work on them for a while
before you are ready to publish them.  When that time comes,
Octopress.el is there to help you.

   Less often, you may want to unpublish a post, returning it to draft
status.  Octopress gives you a couple of simple commands to do this, but
running that command behind Emacs' back creates a few problems.

   First, when you publish or unpublish a piece, the file is moved and
renamed.  If you are currently editing that file, it will disappear and
Emacs will be confused, forcing you to kill the buffer and open the file
at its new location.

   Fortunately, Octopress.el takes care of that for you.

   Simply highlight the draft or post that you wish to publish or
unpublish and press 'P'.  If you are publishing a draft, the draft will
have its publish date added to the Jekyll front matter, the file will be
renamed, and it will be moved to your posts directory.  Any windows
displaying the draft will be swapped to display the post.  Finally,
buffers visiting the draft file are killed.

   If you wish to unpublish a post, you will be prompted to confirm that
you really wish to do so, and then the opposite operation occurs.
